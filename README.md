# Project-Test
JR Photography is a site that advertises my own fictional photography business. The business primarily advertises and sells the service of me who in this alternate reality become a professional freelance Digital Media expert. The website shows off my own photos I took during my Digital Media course and uses them to advertise this fictional business. It is broken up into 3 different sections, Events, Comercial and Nature. The site also provides contact information to hire and book myself to take photos for your business or any events you are hosting.
